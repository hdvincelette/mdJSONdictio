Anyone who has written metadata in mdEditor knows creating dictionaries can be tedious and repetitive. The R package mdJSONdictio aims to streamline this process. Rather than defining data table attributes in [mdEditor](https://go.mdeditor.org/#/dashboard), users can fill out a tabular data dictionary template and format it to mdJSON using the function ```build.mdJSON()```. The resultant mdJSON file can be imported in mdEditor to create a Dictionary record with data table attributes already defined. Conversely, the functon ```build.table()``` allows you to transform mdEditor data dictionary files into a tabular format that be used as a human-readable reference. 
<br />
<br />
<br />

# ```build.mdJSON()``` 

Transforms a tabular data dictionary into an R list that can be subsequently converted to mdJSON and imported to mdEditor as a Dictionary record. The input data frame must be formatted to a template as described in the [Tabular Data Dictionary Template] section. A required parameter is ```title```, which accepts a string to designate the title of the Dictionary record in mdEditor.
<br />
<br />

#### A tabular data dictionary imported as a data frame in R:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

# paged_table(readxl::read_excel(system.file("extdata", "e.g.dictionary.xlsx", package = #"mdJSONdictio")), options=list(cols.print=4))

print(readxl::read_excel(system.file("extdata", "e.g.dictionary.xlsx", package = "mdJSONdictio")), n = 1e3)

```
<br />

#### The function return value in R:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(rjson::fromJSON(file= system.file("extdata", "e.g.dictionary.json", package = "mdJSONdictio")))
```
<br />


# ```build.table()``` 

Transforms an mdEditor mdJSON data dictionary (imported as an R list) into a data frame to be used as a human-readable reference. The output is formatted to the template described in the [Tabular Data Dictionary Template] section. An optional parameter is ```dictionary_num```, which accepts an integer to indicate the dictionary that should be processed if there is more than one in the R list (i.e. if multiple dictionaries are exported together in mdEditor and saved as a single mdJSON file). By default, ```dictionary_num = 1```, so if the mdJSON file only has one dictionary, this parameter can be ignored.
<br />
<br />

#### An mdJSON data dictionary imported as a list in R:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(rjson::fromJSON(file= system.file("extdata", "e.g.dictionary2.json", package = "mdJSONdictio")))
```
<br />

#### The function return value in R:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

print(as_tibble(read.csv(system.file("extdata", "e.g.dictionary2.csv", package = "mdJSONdictio"))))

```
<br />


# Intented Use 

```build.mdJSON()```  is intended for anyone who writes mdEditor metadata. This function is meant to initiate mdEditor Dictionary records, not update them, which should be done manually in the [mdEditor](https://go.mdeditor.org/#/dashboard) web application. It is recommended users maintain the tabular data dictionary as a human-readable reference for associated data product(s). Already have a data dictionary in mdEditor, but not a corresponding tabular data dictionary? Use the ```build.table()``` to transform your mdJSON data dictionary to a tabular format. It is important to note the mdJSON schema is not ordered and mdEditor may export json files with a variety of structures. While the ``build.table()``` attempts to anticipate this variability, you may find your particular mdJSON data dictionary cannot be processed and returns an error. If this happens, please [report a bug](https://github.com/hdvincelette/mdJSONdictio/issues) through the mdJSONdictio GitHub repository.

# Quick Guide to [mdEditor](https://go.mdeditor.org/#/dashboard)

### After building your mdJSON data dictionary:

#### 1. Import the mdJSON data dictionary to mdEditor
Open mdEditor in your browser and navigate to the Import tab at the top of the page. Drag and drop the newly written mdJSON file and click "Import Data." This will generate a Dictionary record with the dictionary title you specified in the function. You may need to refresh your browser if the dictionary does not immediately appear

#### 2. Fix errors in the Dictionary record
When viewing your Dictionary record, you will notice an orange exclamation mark next to the title that indicates the dictionary is incomplete and has missing or erroneous elements. Click the orange exclamation mark to view the details. These errors can be remedied by completing the Responsible Party field in the Main tab and the Entity Code Name and Definition fields in the Entities tab. For more information about these fields, refer to the [mdEditor User Manual](https://guide.mdeditor.org/reference/reference-manual.html). You will know your dictionary is free of errors when the orange triangle disappears and the edit icon next to your Dictionary record in the left-hand menu is green. If you see more than these three errors, make sure the tabular data dictionary is filled out as described in the [Tabular Data Dictionary Template] section.

#### 3. Associate and maintain the Dictionary record
Once the Dictionary record is free of errors, it can be associated with the Metadata record(s) it describes (e.g. tabular dataset, shapefiles) to help create archival quality project metadata. For details of this process and other information, refer to the [mdEditor User Manual](https://guide.mdeditor.org/). Any future updates to your Dictionary record can be done manually in the mdEditor web application. 
<br />
<br />

### Before building your tabular data dictionary:

#### 1. Complete required mdEditor fields
Open mdEditor in your browser and import your mdJSON data dictionary file as described in step 1 above. Navigate to your Dictionary record and verify the contents and check for errors. You will know your dictionary is free of errors when the orange triangle disappears and the edit icon next to your Dictionary record in the left-hand menu is green. While ```build.table()``` only requires an entity with at least one defined attribute, an error-free Dictionary record is more likely to be exported with a structure that can be processed by the function. Please note, if your Dictionary record contains two entities, they will be processed into a single tabular data dictionary.

#### 2. Export the mdJSON data dictionary
Navigate to the Export tab at the top of the page. Make sure no Metadata records, Contacts or undesired Dictionaries are selected (select and deselect the checkboxes under the search bars). Select the desired dictionary and click "Export Selected" to the right of the screen. Save the file to your working space. If you are not prompted to select a save location, the file may have automatically saved to your local Downloads folder. If you intend to transform more than one Dictionary record into a table, you can select and export them together into a single mdJSON file and specify which dictionary is processed by ```build.table()``` with the parameter ```dictionary_num```.
<br />
<br />
<br />

# Tabular Data Dictionary Template

```build.mdJSON()``` only reads data frames formatted to a data dictionary template (Figure 1.1), which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/hdvincelette/mdJSONdictio/blob/master/inst/templates/build.mdJSON_Dictionary_Template.xlsx?raw=true). While csv is a more flexible file format, this template is in xlsx format because it contains validation rules that prevent incorrect values from being entered, resulting in errors when using ```build.mdJSON()``` or creating the Dictionary record in mdEditor.
<br />
<br />

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics(system.file("help/figures","dictionary_template.png", package = "mdJSONdictio"))
```
<br />
<br />
The two main components of the tabular data dictionary template are attributes and entry values, each of which are represented as a row. It is important to remember that while entry values are associated with a certain attribute, not all attributes have defined entry values. For example, the attribute "Sex" may have three defined entry values ("F","M", and "U"), where as the attribute "Year" does not have defined entry values since an unlimited number of years can be entered.
<br />
<br />
Table 1.1 describes the header in the tabular data dictionary template, which represent field(s) in mdEditor Dictionary records. "Definition" describes the template column. Many of these definitions are derived from the [mdEditor User Manual](https://guide.mdeditor.org/reference/edit-window/dictionary/dictionary-record.html). "DataType" indicates the type of value allowed in the template column. "Required" indicates whether the template column is required by attributes and/or entry values ("No" indicates it is not required by either attributes or entry values). 
<br />
<br />
 
Note:

- The template columns "codeName," "domainItem_name," "domainItem_value," and "definition" are all required by attributes and entry values.
- The template columns "dataType" and "allowNull" are required by attributes
<br />
<br />

<em>Tip: View attribute rows by filtering the dictionary column "domainItem_name" to "colname" and verify all rows have values for dictionary columns "dataType" and "allowNull".</em>
<br />

```
</font>
<br />
<br />
"dataType" is the only dictionary column with defined entry values. These are derived from the mdEditor web application. The definitions in Table 1.2 were acquired from the [mdCodes Viewer](https://adiwg.github.io/mdTools/#codes-page) in the mdTools interface.
